Grade 12 Computer Science intro projects solutions

[Mr. Varsava project list](http://mrvarsava.weebly.com/ics4u-project-list.html)

## Review

1. Create a five function calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus division). The program should request two operands, an operator and ask if the user wishes to perform additional calculations. [`complete`](src/calculator.cpp)
2. For 70%, create a program that determines if a given seven-letter word is a palindrome. For +30%, the program should be able to accept any size of user input. [`complete`](src/palindrome.cpp)
3. Create a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given value specified by the user i.e input = 20, output = 1,1,2,3,5,8,13. [`complete`](src/fibonacci.cpp)

## External File Use

4. Decode the file named source.txt which has been shared with you via Google drive. It is encoded using a ROT13 encryption. The text itself is an excerpt from a novel. Submit your code, the decrypted text and the name of the source novel. [`complete`](src/ROT13.cpp)
5. Create a text-based adventure/RPG game and implement a save/load game feature. For 70%, the program should save/load to/from a specific external file. For +30%, allow the user to specify the filename of the file to load/save. [`complete`](src/textGame.cpp)

## Sorting

6. Create a program that implements a Cocktail Shaker Sort on a data set of 10 elements. Ex: Allow for the user to enter values. EX2: Allow the user to specify the number of elements they would like to include in the data set.

## Computer Vision

7. Follow the video tutorial series [here](www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FYm3GOonhk). Complete the three projects specified at the end of the video.

8. Create a computer vision project of your own design. Potential ideas include something that recognizes your face, a hand-gesture interpreter, or a Where's Waldo solver.
